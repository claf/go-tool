`go` is a small shell command for changing directories quickly. Typically you have a set of directories that you work in. Typing out the names of those dirs in full can be tedious. `go` allows you to give a shortcut name for a directory -- say `ko` for `D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel` -- and do the following:

```
C:\> go ko
D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel>
```

and

```
C:\> go ko/test
D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel\test>
```

These examples are from Windows (in the `cmd.exe` shell), but `go` works for Linux, Mac, etc. as well.

Think of it as a **super cd**. See GettingStarted for more details.
